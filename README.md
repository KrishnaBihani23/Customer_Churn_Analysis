# Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on predicting credit card customers who are likely to churn (leave the bank) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help financial institutions identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for banks offering credit card services. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project analyzes customer behavior and predicts churn to support data-driven decision making.

## Dataset
The dataset contains credit card customer information including:
- Customer demographics
- Credit limit and account details
- Transaction count and transaction amount
- Customer activity and usage patterns

Target variable:
- **Churn status** (Existing Customer / Attrited Customer)

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Machine learning classification model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
The model is able to classify customers as churned or non-churned based on their behavioral and financial attributes.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
